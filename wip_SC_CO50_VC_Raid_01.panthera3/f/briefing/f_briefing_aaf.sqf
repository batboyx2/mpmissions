We're very limited by the skill of our civilian scouts and thus our info is fuzzy, but what we do know is that there are three lightly guarded roadblocks being used by the USMC down the valley marked on your map. These roadblocks are being used by the enemy to oppress the local population. We want them taken out by any means necessary. Don't get pinned down, keeping mobile will ensure that the conventional army of the enemy won't be able to fix you with fire and surround you.
