Wavelength
==================================================

WL is a derivative of the [F3](http://ferstaberinde.com/f3/en//index.php?title=Main_Page) work. The content we have edited mainly consists of minor edits to gear, addition of many more factions from mods, and tweaks to the code, as well as a few minor additions. You can track F3's development at https://github.com/ferstaberinde/F3. 

If you wish to have a translator that can speak more than one language you can place this in the units init line to allow him to speak any languages of your choice: 
```sqf
this setVariable ["f_languages", ["english","russian","arabic"]];
```

Note that in WL, BLUFOR speaks English, OPFOR speaks Russian and INDFOR speaks Arabic. You can edit those defaults in lines 46 to 48 of f\radios\acre2\acre2_settings.sqf

You may change the languages in the code to the following supported languages, but remember what the default factions speak!

Enlish
Russian
Arabic
Czech
German
Greek
Farsi
French
Chinese
Ukrainian 

You can add more languages on line 42 of f\radios\acre2\acre2_settings.sqf
