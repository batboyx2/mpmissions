Dawn of the Apocalypse

Map: Chernarus

Players: 1-2

Story:
A part of South Zagoria has been overrun in the cover of a Sunday night's darkness. Your company was taken by surprise and every man is either dead or hiding. There is no way to get south so you have to alert the rest of the country by broadcasting a warning at the Green Mountain broadcasting tower.

Description:
This is a zombie SP/coop mission with a specific objective and one life per character. The zombies are resistant to bullets, and only a headshot is a reliable way to kill them. This is a prologue mission to the Chernarus Apocalypse series.
